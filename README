Notes on the Spend Network morph scrapers for spend files. (sp_)
================================================================

Where possible, try to stick to the template, editing only the 'VARIABLES' and 'SCRAPE DATA' sections.
This is to keep future editing easier and possible with Search/Replace function.
Especially as we move in to 100s of scrapers.

#### IMPORTS 1.0
#### FUNCTIONS 1.0
#### VARIABLES 1.0
#### READ HTML 1.0
#### SCRAPE DATA
#### STORE DATA 1.0
#### EOF



The goal of the SCRAPE DATA section is to create the 'data' list in this format.

[[csvYr, csvMth, url],
[csvYr, csvMth, url],
[csvYr, csvMth, url]]

Any extra module imports or code needed to achieve this should stay in this section.



For quaterly files, try to save the quarter in the 'csvMth' variable with this relationship:

Q1 = Jan-Mar
Q2 = Apr-Jun
Q3 = Jul-Sep
Q4 = Oct-Dec

If the source uses different months or they can not be identified, save as Q0.
